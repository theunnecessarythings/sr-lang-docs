## 🚀 Getting Started

To build and run the compiler, you will need:

*   **Zig Compiler:** The project is built using Zig.
*   **LLVM/MLIR Development Libraries:** The compiler links against MLIR for its backend. 

### Building LLVM/MLIR

```bash
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project
export LLVM_HOME=llvm-project

# Install libc++
sudo apt install libc++-dev libc++abi-dev # For Ubuntu/Debian
cd llvm-project
mkdir build
cd build
CXXFLAGS=-stdlib=libc++ cmake -G Ninja ../llvm    -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=mlir     -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="Native;NVPTX;AMDGPU"    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release    -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="clang" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="clang++" -DLLVM_ENABLE_LLD=ON
ninja
cmake --install .
```

### Building the Compiler

Navigate to the root of the `sr-lang` repository and run:

```bash
zig build
```

This command will compile the `sr-lang` compiler executable.

### Running Examples

**Please Note:** As of now, only the `examples/hello.sr` example is fully functional and runnable. Other examples demonstrate language features and syntax but may not compile or execute correctly yet.

To run the "hello world" example:

```bash
zig build run -- examples/hello.sr
```

Alternatively, after building, you can directly run the executable:

```bash
./zig-out/bin/sr_lang examples/hello.sr
```
