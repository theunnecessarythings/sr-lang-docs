sr-lang is a new systems programming language designed for performance, safety, and developer productivity. It leverages the LLVM MLIR framework for its backend, enabling powerful optimizations and targeting diverse hardware.

## Key Features

*   **MLIR Backend:** Directly integrates with MLIR for advanced compiler optimizations and flexible target generation.
*   **Comptime Evaluation:** Execute code at compile time for metaprogramming, code generation, and static assertions.
*   **Generics & Polymorphism:** Write flexible and reusable code with compile-time checked generics.
*   **Async/Await:** Built-in support for asynchronous programming for efficient I/O and concurrency.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling with error union types and `!` propagation.
*   **Low-Level Control:** Fine-grained control over memory with pointers and direct MLIR/assembly integration.
*   **Rich Type System:** Modern type system with structs, enums, variants (sum types), and dynamic arrays.
*   **FFI:** Seamless interoperability with C and other languages.

## Why sr-lang?

sr-lang aims to provide a sweet spot between high-level productivity and low-level control. It's ideal for:

*   **Systems Programming:** Operating systems, embedded systems, device drivers.
*   **High-Performance Computing:** Scientific simulations, game engines, numerical analysis.
*   **Machine Learning:** Custom ML kernels, research, and deployment.
*   **Tooling:** Compilers, interpreters, and development tools.
