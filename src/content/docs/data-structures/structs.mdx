## Structs

**Structs** are composite data types that allow you to group together related data under a single name. Each piece of data in a struct is called a **field**, and each field has its own name and type. Structs are one of the most common ways to create more complex and meaningful data structures in your programs.

### Defining and Instantiating Structs

You define a struct using the `struct` keyword, followed by a block containing the field definitions.

To create an instance of a struct, you use the struct name followed by a literal block where you provide values for the fields.

```go
// Define a struct named `Point`
Point :: struct { x: i32, y: i32 };

// Create an instance of the Point struct
p := Point{ x: 10, y: 20 };

// Access the fields using dot notation
printf("Point: (%d, %d)\n", p.x, p.y);
```

**Output:**
```
Point: (10, 20)
```

Structs can contain fields of any type, including other structs, allowing you to build up complex, nested data structures.

```go
// A struct can contain fields of different primitive types
User :: struct { id: i32, name: string, active: bool };

u := User{ id: 1, name: "Alice", active: true };
printf("User: %d, %s, %b\n", u.id, u.name, u.active);
```

**Output:**
```
User: 1, Alice, 1
```

### Nested Structs

You can nest structs to create hierarchical data. For example, a `Rect` can be composed of two `Point` structs.

```go
Point :: struct { x: i32, y: i32 };
Rect  :: struct { tl: Point, br: Point }; // tl: top-left, br: bottom-right

// Instantiate the nested struct
r := Rect{ tl: Point{ x: 0, y: 0 }, br: Point{ x: 10, y: 10 } };

// Access nested fields using chained dot notation
printf("Rect: (%d, %d) to (%d, %d)\n", r.tl.x, r.tl.y, r.br.x, r.br.y);
```

**Output:**
```
Rect: (0, 0) to (10, 10)
```

### Struct Update Syntax

sr-lang supports a functional update syntax that allows you to create a new struct instance based on an existing one, while changing only the fields you specify. The `..` syntax copies the remaining fields from the source struct.

```go
Point :: struct { x: i32, y: i32 };

p1 := Point{ x: 10, y: 20 };

// Create p2 with a new `x` value, but copy the `y` value from p1
p2 := Point{ x: 5, ..p1 };

printf("P2: (%d, %d)\n", p2.x, p2.y);
```

**Output:**
```
P2: (5, 20)
```
