## Maps (Hash Maps)

A **Map** (also known as a hash map, dictionary, or associative array) is a data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs. Each key in a map must be unique, and it is used to look up its corresponding value. Maps are incredibly versatile and are one of the most important data structures in modern programming.

### Defining Maps

You define a map using the `[K:V]` type syntax, where `K` is the type of the keys and `V` is the type of the values. You can initialize a map with a literal syntax.

```go
// Create a map with string keys and integer values
m: [string:i32] = ["one": 1, "two": 2];

printf("Map size: %d\n", m.len);
```

**Output:**
```
Map size: 2
```

### Basic Operations

Maps provide a set of methods for inserting, accessing, and removing elements.

#### Inserting and Updating

You can insert a new key-value pair or update the value for an existing key using the subscript `[]` syntax.

```go
m: [string:i32] = ["one": 1];

// Insert a new key-value pair
m["two"] = 2;

// Update the value for an existing key
m["one"] = 11;

printf("Map: one=%d, two=%d\n", m["one"], m["two"]);
```

**Output:**
```
Map: one=11, two=2
```

#### Accessing Values

You access the value associated with a key using the same subscript syntax.

> **Note:** If you try to access a key that does not exist in the map, the behavior may be undefined or result in a runtime error. Future versions of the language will introduce safer access methods that return an optional.

```go
m: [string:i32] = ["one": 1, "two": 2];

val := m["one"];
printf("Value of 'one': %d\n", val);
```

**Output:**
```
Value of 'one': 1
```

#### Removing Elements

You can remove a key-value pair from the map using the `remove` method.

```go
m: [string:i32] = ["one": 1, "two": 2];

m.remove("one");

printf("Map size after remove: %d\n", m.len);
```

**Output:**
```
Map size after remove: 1
```
