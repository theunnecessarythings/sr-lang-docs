## Block Expressions

In sr-lang, a block of code enclosed in curly braces `{}` can be used as an expression. The last expression in the block is the value that the block evaluates to. This is a powerful feature that allows for more complex logic to be embedded directly where a value is expected.

### Basic Usage

A block expression can be used to initialize a variable with a value that requires multiple steps to compute.

```go
x := {
    a := 10;
    b := 20;
    a + b; // This is the value the block returns
};
// x is now 30
```

### Scoping

Variables declared inside a block expression are local to that block and do not pollute the outer scope.

```go
outer_var := 10;
{
    inner_var := 20;
    printf("Inner var: %d\n", inner_var);
}
// inner_var is not accessible here
printf("Outer var: %d\n", outer_var);
```

### Nested Blocks

Block expressions can be nested, allowing for more complex and structured code.

```go
x := {
    y := {
        1 + 1;
    };
    y * 3;
};
// x is now 6
```

Block expressions are a versatile feature that can help in writing cleaner and more organized code, especially when dealing with complex initializations or computations.
